                        <br>
                        <p>Sensing the growing demand for quality products, New Age invested heavily in infrastructure
                            comprising Cold storages and logistics equipment (Reefer Trucks). New Age established a
                            stable infrastructure that supported optimal distribution of products at the most economic

                        <br>
                        <p>The world is changing all around us. To continue to thrive as a business over the next ten
                            years and beyond, we must look ahead; understand the trends and forces that will shape our
                            business in the future and move swiftly to prepare for what's to come. We must get ready for
                            tomorrow today. That's what our new business strategy is all about. The business strategy we
                            put in place a year ago is based on expanding the market and exporting goods out of Nigeria
                            to create FOREX to support our country’s trade balance. In addition, we acquired 100
                            (Hundreds) Acres of Land in Kuta, Osun State and Kobape, Ogun State for Fish Farm for
                            Harvesting close to 1000 MT Annually and other agricultural produce. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Expanding the market is designed to ensure that we continue to deliver stellar short-and long
                            –term business result and continues to have impact in the market. Over the past few months,
                            we've taken on some of the biggest challenge and most significant change in the company's
                            history. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Our focus has clearly been on rebuilding our foundation, which allows our company to catch up
                            with 21st century ways of running a company. We’ve made significant investment in providing
                            employees with the learning and training opportunities that they need to be top performers.
                            Our focus is to invest heavily on our equipments and build new branches at strategic
                            locations around the country, and also reinvigorate our product line with more variety of
                            frozen foods. </p>
